<h3>Package ownership</h3>
<div>
  {{^has_publisher}}
  <p>
    You can transfer this package to a verified publisher if you are a member of the given publisher.
    Transferring the package removes the current uploaders, so that only the members of the publisher can upload new versions.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Upgrading to verified publishers is an irreversible operation.</strong>
    Packages can be transferred between publishers, but they can't be converted back to legacy uploader ownership.
  </p>
  {{/has_publisher}}
  {{#has_publisher}}
  <p>
    You can transfer your package to a <strong>different publisher</strong>
    if you’re also a member of the given publisher.
