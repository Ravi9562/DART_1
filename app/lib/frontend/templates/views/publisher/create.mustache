<h2>Create a publisher</h2>

<p>
  A publisher consists of a group of users who collectively owns a set of
  packages. A publisher is identified by a verified domain name. This lends
  further credibility to packages owned by the publisher, as such packages
  can be said to be published by the owner of the given domain.
</p>
<p>
  To create a publisher,
  you need to be a <i>verified domain property</i> owner in
  <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Google Search Console</a>.
  For help see <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/34592?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Add a website property</a>.
  <br /><br />
  Note: It is not sufficient to verify a <i>URL prefix property</i>, or to be added as a collaborator on a property
  somebody else verified. The user account used to create a publisher must have verified the <i>domain property</i>.
  Once verified and a publisher has been created on pub.dev continued domain verification is not a requirement.
  you need to be a site administrator in
  <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Google Search Console</a>
  (formerly: Google Webmaster Tools).
