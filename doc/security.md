## Security advisories for packages

In case of a vulnerability regarding a specific package, use GitHub’s [security
advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory)
feature to create a new security advisory. GitHub will review and ingest the
advisory into the central [GitHub Advisory
database](https://github.com/advisories) where you can also go search for
vulnerabilities in the Pub ecosystem.
