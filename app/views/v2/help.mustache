  <h2 id="scoring">Scoring</h2>
  <p>
    We calculate <a href="#popularity">popularity</a>, <a href="#health">health</a> and
    <a href="#maintenance">maintenance</a> scores independently, and combine them into
    an <a href="#overall-score">overall score</a>. The score you see in the colored circle
    is always this overall score.
  </p>

  <h3 id="popularity">Popularity</h3>
  <p>
    Popularity score is good proxy for a package's use, derived from download statistics.
    It is based on actual download counts, but compensated for automated tools (like
    continuous builds fetching the package on each change request).
  </p>

  <p><i>How can you improve your popularity score?</i></p>
  <p>Create useful packages that others needs and love to use.</p>

  <h3 id="health">Health</h3>
  <p>
    The code health score is based on the static analysis of the package with <code class="hljs">dartanalyzer</code>.
  </p>
  <p><i>How can you improve your health score?</i></p>
  <p>Use strong-mode checks and some linter rules, and make sure you fix all the warnings and errors before publishing. An example <code>analysis_options.yaml</code>:</p>
  <pre><code class="hljs">
# https://www.dartlang.org/guides/language/analysis-options
analyzer:
  strong-mode: true

# Source of linter options:
# http://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/options/options.html
linter:
  rules:
    - camel_case_types
    - hash_and_equals
    - iterable_contains_unrelated_type
    - list_remove_unrelated_type
    - unrelated_type_equality_checks
    - valid_regexps

  </code></pre>

  <h3 id="maintenance">Maintenance</h3>

  <p>
    Maintenance score reflects how tidy and up-to-date a package is.
    Some of aspects that influence the score:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Last publish date: a package starts to loose score a year its last publish data.</li>
    <li>Up-to-date dependencies: great if all of the dependencies are on the latest version.</li>
    <li>Readme, changelog and example files.</li>
    <li><code class="hljs">analysis_options.yaml</code> with strong-mode enabled.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><i>How can you improve your maintenance score?</i></p>
  <p>
    Follow the suggestions on the analysis tab on the package page, or
    run <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/pana">pana</a> manually
    to check these before publishing.
  </p>

  <h3 id="overall-score">Overall score</h3>
  <p>
    The overall score is the combination of <a href="#popularity">popularity</a>,
    <a href="#health">health</a> and <a href="#maintenance">maintenance</a>.
  </p>
