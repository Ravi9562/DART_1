# Code for the "pub.dev" website.

The server for hosting pub packages on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev)
is implemented using AppEngine Custom Runtimes with Flexible environment
(see [package:appengine](https://pub.dev/packages/appengine) for more information about
Dart support for AppEngine).

This code isn't designed with private hosting in mind. 
If you need a private hosted environment, you may find some of the suggestions in
[this page](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/custom-package-repositories)
to be helpful.
